### Time to Dive Right In

We‚Äôre going to jump straight into the deep end by running a worked example you‚Äôve already prepared in the summary and setup section. Don‚Äôt be intimidated if you don‚Äôt understand everything right away, that‚Äôs perfectly okay. This is just a high-level pass to give you context and a feel for the overall process. Throughout the week, each session will break down these steps in more detail so you‚Äôll build a deeper understanding as we go.

## Scenario: Pick a Penguin üêß

A team of marine biologists working in Antarctica is keen to **identify penguin species**, as the balance between these species is a critical indicator of climate change and the overall health of marine ecosystems. However, capturing penguins to determine their species is both **costly** and **disruptive to the wildlife**.

To reduce costs and disturbance, they are investigating whether remote camera stations equipped with automated detection algorithms could track and log colonies of penguins without physical handling. As a **first step**, they want to assess how reliably **species can be classified based on observable features**.

**They have already assembled a dataset** containing individual penguins with known species labels, along with associated characteristics such as the island they were found on, bill length and depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex.

Based on this dataset, they want to explore the following question:

::: callout
### Problem definition

#### Can **penguin species** (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) be accurately **predicted** from **location, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, weight,** and **sex**? Additionally, which of these **features contribute most** to distinguishing between species?

### Your task

We‚Äôll use this scenario to walk through the typical stages of a machine learning project. Now that we‚Äôve established the problem definition, the next steps on our journey are:
- **Import the data:** Get our tabular penguin data into our environment.
- **Data exploration:** Examine the dataset to understand what it contains and identify any missing or unusual values.
- **Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data so that it can be used in a machine learning model.
- **Model selection:** Choose an appropriate algorithm to predict species based on the available features.
- **Training and testing:** Split the data to fairly evaluate model performance.
- **Evaluation:** Assess how accurately your model predicts species and investigate which features are most important.

## Setup

```{python}
# import the libraries we intend to use

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

<br>
<br>

## Import the data

```{python}
# use pandas to import our csv datafile
df_peng = pd.read_csv('data/penguins.csv')
```

## Inspect the data

```{python}
# Show me first 10 rows and the shape of the table
print(df_peng.head(10))
print(df_peng.shape)
```

```{python}
# Which features can we insepect the distribtuion?
features = ['bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g']

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
# enumerate gives us a numeric value as well as our feature during our loop
for i, feature in enumerate(features, 1): #starting from 1 in our numeric loop
    plt.subplot(2, 2, i) # plot position
    df_peng[feature].hist(bins=10) #create a histogram from our feature with 10 bins 
    # add axis labels
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.ylabel('Count')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
